# Paradigm

- Imperative
  - Procedual
  - Object Oriented
- Declarative
  - Functional
  - Logical
  - Mathematical

Paradigm is a way of classify a programming language by its functionalities.

Each paradigm have a mainly concern:
- execution model (allow or not side effects?)
- way code is organized 
- style of syntax and grammar

They can be classified by what it can or cant be done.



1) Object-Oriented (Java, Smalltalk)

This paradigm abstracts a software as a collection of interactives objects. 
Each object can be saw as a small independenty machine with a different role or resposability
Abstraction is close to the real world
Uses techniques:
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Modulatiry

2) Functional (Haskell, Schema)

This paradigm abstracts a software as a sequence of functions executed in a stack

Disadvantages: 
- 

3) Structured Programing

4) Declarative Programing (SQL)

This paradigm describe the problem to the software but not the resolution. It was given the data, but not the logic.
It use some rules to evaluate the results

5) Logic
